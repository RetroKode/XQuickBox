# XQuickBox (Pre-Alpha)
The savior project to **create web sites with native Python** code! Design static landings pages in minutes with **Python**. Use the prebuilt components to **generate common HTML objects** like "navs" with prefabricated structures or design them yourself to create the coolest things that cross your mind.

This is an OpenSource project **created with the purpose of facilitating the creation of "generic" websites** easily, quickly and 100% **from Python**. Let's forget about writing HTML.

For easier (and more indicated) use **install the Python package using pip** and read the **documentation**, unless you want to collaborate, which is always available!
